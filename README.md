# AutonomousRobotNavigation
This code runs on the Rabbit BL2600 microprocessor using Digi's Dynamic C compiler. The code is compatible with a 3 tri-switch custom built robot. 

See the pdf file for more information on how the robot was built, programmed, and designed.

See the ver5 code for the final code used within this project.
